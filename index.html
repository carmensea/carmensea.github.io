        <h2>What makes a good  playlist?</h2>
        <p class="flex">A good playlist is more than just a bunch of good songs thrown in random order.</p>
        <p class="flex">A great, memorable playlist is more personal than it is random.</p>
        <p class="flex">You're asking to take up minutes-to hours of someone's day.</p>
        <p class="flex">This means you should put ample time in creating something for them.</p>

        <h2>Some things to consider:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="flex">For whom is the playlist?</li>
          <li class="flex">What message are you trying to convey?</li>
          <li class="flex">Is there a certain song you feel encompasses your message already?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sometimes a certain song will inspire you to make an entire playlist. This is helpful, because you'll already know your message. If not, narrowing down your audience, and figuring out your message will be immensely helpful.</p>

    <!--- <h4 id="samps">Are all playlists this heavy?</h4>
    <p class="heavy">Yes and no. Every playlist should mean something to do you. You should put hard work into making it, because someone else will be listening to it. They don't have to have a deep meaning like above. For instance, I have many playlists. I have a driving playlist. I have a slow driving playlist. There's running playlists. One of my favorite things to listen to is a <a href="party.html">"Party Playlist"</a>.

    <p>I found the website <a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/five-keys-making-good-playlist">"5 Ways Anyone Can Make a Playlist"</a>
    <ol>
      <li>I like their main photo better, because it's centered. I like their layout a bit more. I know we'll learn this next week, so I'm sure my page will look nice too.</li>
      <li>There's a lot of code in the page source. I think most of it has to do with the advertising. It also has dropdowns where you can link to Facebook or Pinterest. I think that's what the tags do.</li>
