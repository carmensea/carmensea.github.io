    <h1>What makes a good playlist?</h1>
      <p><a href="history-of-cassettes.html">"Playlists"</a> are very personal. Some people just throw songs onto a playlist and call it a day.</p>
      <p>That doesn't make a good playlist. That's lazy. That's impersonal.</p>
      <p><strong>No one will really appreciate it.</strong> </p>
      <p>Sure, they might think some songs are catchy. You didn't put your blood, sweat, and tears into it, though.</p>
      <p><em>They'll know.</em></p>
    <h2>So, how do I make the best playlist?</h2>
    <p>I'm glad you asked.</p>
    <p>Here are the very first things you need to do:
    <ul>
      <li>For whom is the playlist?</li>
      <li>What message are you trying to convey?</li>
      <li>Is there a certain song you feel encompasses your message already?</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>These are the most important questions, because this makes your playlist personal. If you're giving everyone the same mix, no one is going to feel special. People are different. You don't make the same playlist for everyone.</p>
    <h3>Okay, now what?</h3>
    <p>This is more of a basic guideline. People have very different tastes in music. I think you can follow the table below to get a general idea of what you'd want in your mix.</p>

    <p><h4>Are all playlists this heavy?</h4></p>
    <p>Yes and no. Every playlist should mean something to do you. You should put hard work into making it, because someone else will be listening to it. They don't have to have a deep meaning like above. For instance, I have many playlists. I have a driving playlist. I have a slow driving playlist. There's running playlists. One of my favorite things to listen to is a <a href="party.html">"Party Playlist"</a>.
    <p>Enjoy making your playlists!</p>
