    <h1>What Makes a Great Party Mix?</h1>
    <p>A great party playlist is a mix between people being familiar with the catchy, dance songs, several unknown indie songs, as well as some fun throwbacks.</p>
    <p>People are open to music, but they also love to hear something familiar. If you're playing back to back songs that no one's ever heard of, people aren't going to love it. They may be the best songs (and they probably are), but people want to sing. People want to hear stuff they've heard before.</p>
    <p>A good rule of thumb is to put three unknown songs in a row, and then add a current hit from today. If you're playing songs people don't know, you have to put a throwback song to ensure that you're catering to everyone (not just your eclectic self).</p>
    <p>It's a good idea to poll your party attendees with a song request before your party. That way, you can be sure to have something everyone loves.</p>
    <p>If you absolutely hate a song, I wouldn't recommend putting it on the playlist.</p>
    <p>So let's recap:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For every three unknown songs, one current hit.</li>
      <li>Poll your guests before the party to get a feel of what they want.</li>
      <li>Put some oldies dance songs on, because nothing makes a playlist as memorable as variety.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is a sample Party Playlist</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Arkells - My Heart's Always Yours</li>
        <li>Most People - Telephone</li>

        <li><strong><em>Foster The People</em></strong></li>
        <li><strong><em>Aretha Franklin - Respect</em></strong></li>
        <li><strong><em>Whitney Houston - I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)</em></strong></li>
        <li><strong><em>Justin Timberlake - Rock Your Body</em></strong></li>
        <li>Miike Snow - The Heart Of Me</li>
        <li>Feist - 1234 (Van She Remix)</li>
        <li><strong><em>Spice Girls - Wannabe</em></strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>The <strong>bold</strong> songs are songs from today that everyone probably knows. The <strong><em>bold and italicized</em></strong> songs are throwbacks that will win you huge points.</p>
      <p>You don't have to put the songs on this list on your playlist. You should pick your own songs, and you should make it as long as you want. Because today we're not using cassettes, you don't have to worry about what the first and last song is. For a party playlist, I wouldn't worry too much, because I would hit shuffle.</p>
      <p>The best thing about making a party playlist is when someone tells you that it's one of their favorites mixes.</p>
