    <p>This is a cassette. What goes on it can be <em>totally</em> magical.</p>

    <p>Back in the day, you had to sit by the radio and wait for your song to come on. Once you heard the first note, you'd quickly press <strong>record</strong>. </p>

    <p>Imagine that you had a list of songs that you thought were perfect for the one you loved. Or maybe you were into the heavy, emotional music that you really wanted to share with someone. <strong>You'd have to listen all day to the radio for the right song, in the right order</strong>.</p>

    <p>Lucky for you, today we have <a href= "http://spotify.com">"Spotify"</a>. Gone are the days of waiting to hear a certain song. Gone are the days of rewinding a tape. Now, you can drag and drop.</p>
